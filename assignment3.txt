Problem 1 [20 points]. Design an extension of the basic Boolean model that 
would allow for ranking of the retrieved documents. Be as detailed as possible.

Problem 2 [30 points]. Write a (Perl or Python) script that displays the 
vocabulary and frequency of each word in the main page of the class' website 
and on all other documents directly linked from the main page. For each
word, also compute in how many different documents it occurs in this
small collection. You must use hashes.
