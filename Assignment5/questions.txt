Problem 1 [40 points]. Write a (Perl or Python) program that generates the 
inverted index of a set of already preprocessed files. The files are stored 
in a directory which is given as an input parameter to the program. Use the 
files preprocessed in the previous assignment(s) as test data. Use raw term 
frequency (tf) in the document without normalizing it. Think about saving the 
generated index, including the document frequency (df), in a file so that you 
can retrieve it later.
